/* WHY DO I HAVE PET PEEVE ON HYPOCRITES
I really really dislike hypocrites.
It is because when you are lecturing someone about their bad habits or bad behaviour,
you as someone lecturing about that bad habit must not have that bad habit yourself.
I just find it really iritating especially when someone blunders of doing good things and changing your bad habits,
but they themselves don't do that.
Basically, how can I have the urge to change my bad habits and bad behaviour when the person saying it to me don't even do it.
In general, hyprocrite people really gives me the ick.*/
